Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, 
so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that 
has null for its own prototype.

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
